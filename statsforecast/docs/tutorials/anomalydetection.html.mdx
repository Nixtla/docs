## Introduction

Anomaly detection is a crucial task in time series forecasting. It
involves identifying unusual observations that don’t follow the expected
dataset patterns. Anomalies, also known as outliers, can be caused by a
variety of factors, such as errors in the data collection process,
sudden changes in the underlying patterns of the data, or unexpected
events. They can pose problems for many forecasting models since they
can distort trends, seasonal patterns, or autocorrelation estimates. As
a result, anomalies can have a significant impact on the accuracy of the
forecasts, and for this reason, it is essential to be able to identify
them. Furthermore, anomaly detection has many applications across
different industries, such as detecting fraud in financial data,
monitoring the performance of online services, or identifying usual
patterns in energy usage.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a good understanding of how to
detect anomalies in time series data using
[StatsForecast](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/)’s probabilistic
models.

**Outline:**

1.  Install libraries
2.  Load and explore data
3.  Train model
4.  Recover insample forecasts and identify anomalies

<Important>

### Important

Once an anomaly has been identified, we must decide what to do with it.
For example, we could remove it or replace it with another value. The
correct course of action is context-dependent and beyond this notebook’s
scope. Removing an anomaly will likely improve the accuracy of the
forecast, but it can also underestimate the amount of randomness in the
data.

</Tip>

## Install libraries

We assume that you have StatsForecast already installed. If not, check
this guide for instructions on [how to install
StatsForecast](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/examples/installation.html)

Install the necessary packages using `pip install statsforecast`

```python
pip install statsforecast -U
```

## Load and explore the data

For this example, we’ll use the hourly dataset of the [M4
Competition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0169207019301128).
We’ll first import the data from
[datasetsforecast](https://github.com/Nixtla/datasetsforecast/tree/main/),
which you can install using `pip install datasetsforecast`

```python
pip install datasetsforecast -U
```


```python
from datasetsforecast.m4 import M4
```

The function to load the data is `M4.load`. It requieres the following
two arguments:

-   `directory`: (str) The directory where the data will be downloaded.
-   `group`: (str). The group name, which can be `Yearly`, `Quarterly`,
    `Monthly`, `Weekly`, `Daily` or `Hourly`.

This function returns multiple outputs, but only the first one with the
target series is needed.

```python
df_total, *_ = M4.load('./data', 'Hourly')
df_total.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds  | y     |
|-----|-----------|-----|-------|
| 0   | H1        | 1   | 605.0 |
| 1   | H1        | 2   | 586.0 |
| 2   | H1        | 3   | 586.0 |
| 3   | H1        | 4   | 559.0 |
| 4   | H1        | 5   | 511.0 |

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in [long
format](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/wide-and-long-data/) with
three columns: `unique_id`, `df` and `y`.

-   `unique_id`: (string, int or category) A unique identifier for the
    series.
-   `ds`: (datestamp or int) A datestamp in format YYYY-MM-DD or
    YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS or an integer indexing time.
-   `y`: (numeric) The measurement we wish to forecast.

In this case, the `unique_id` and `y` columns already have the requiered
format, but we need to change the data type of the `ds` column.

```python
df_total['ds'] = df_total['ds'].astype(int)
```

From this dataset, we’ll select the first 8 time series to reduce the
total execution time. You can select any number you want by changing the
value of `n_series`.

```python
n_series = 8 
uids = df_total['unique_id'].unique()[:n_series]
df = df_total.query('unique_id in @uids')
```

We can plot these series using the `plot` method from the StatsForecast
class. This method has multiple parameters, and the required ones to
generate the plots in this notebook are explained below.

-   `df`: A pandas dataframe with columns \[unique_id, ds, y\].
-   `forecasts_df`: A pandas dataframe with columns \[unique_id, ds\]
    and models.
-   `unique_ids`: (list\[str\]) A list with the ids of the time series
    we want to plot.
-   `plot_random`: (bool = True) Plots the time series randomly.
-   `plot_anomalies`: (bool = False) Plots anomalies for each prediction
    interval.
-   `engine`: (str = plotly). The library used to generate the plots. It
    can also be matplotlib for static plots.

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
```


```python
StatsForecast.plot(df, plot_random = False)
```

## Train model

To generate the forecast, we’ll use the
[MSTL](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/models.html#multiple-seasonalities)
model, which is well-suited for low-frequency data like the one used
here. We first need to import it from `statsforecast.models` and then we
need to instantiate it. Since we’re using hourly data, we have two
seasonal periods: one every 24 hours (hourly) and one every 24\*7 hours
(daily). Hence, we need to set `season_length = [24, 24*7]`.

```python
from statsforecast.models import MSTL

# Create a list of models and instantiation parameters 
models = [MSTL(season_length = [24, 24*7])]
```

To instantiate a new StatsForecast object, we need the following
parameters:

-   `df`: The dataframe with the training data.
-   `models`: The list of models defined in the previous step.
-   `freq`: A string indicating the frequency of the data. See [pandas’
    available
    frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).
-   `n_jobs`: An integer that indicates the number of jobs used in
    parallel processing. Use -1 to select all cores.

```python
sf = StatsForecast(
    df = df, 
    models = models, 
    freq = 'H', 
    n_jobs = -1
)
```

We’ll now predict the next 48 hours. To do this, we’ll use the
[`forecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/ets.html#forecast)
method, which requieres the following arguments:

-   `h`: (int) The forecasting horizon.
-   `level`: (list\[float\]) The confidence levels of the prediction
    intervals
-   `fitted`: (bool = False) Returns insample predictions.

It is important that we select a `level` and set `fitted = True` since
we’ll need the insample forecasts and their prediction intervals to
detect the anomalies.

```python
horizon = 48
levels = [99] 

fcst = sf.forecast(h = 48, level = levels, fitted = True)
fcst = fcst.reset_index()
fcst.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds  | MSTL       | MSTL-lo-99 | MSTL-hi-99 |
|-----|-----------|-----|------------|------------|------------|
| 0   | H1        | 749 | 615.943970 | 597.662170 | 634.225708 |
| 1   | H1        | 750 | 559.297791 | 531.316650 | 587.278931 |
| 2   | H1        | 751 | 515.693542 | 479.151337 | 552.235718 |
| 3   | H1        | 752 | 480.719269 | 436.241547 | 525.197021 |
| 4   | H1        | 753 | 467.146484 | 415.199738 | 519.093262 |

We can plot the forecasts using the `plot` method from before.

```python
StatsForecast.plot(df, fcst, plot_random = False)
```

## Recover insample forecasts and identify anomalies

In this example, an **anomaly** will be any observation outside the
prediction interval of the insample forecasts for a given confidence
level (here we selected 99%). Hence, we first need to recover the
insample forecasts using the `forecast_fitted_values` method.

```python
insample_forecasts = sf.forecast_fitted_values().reset_index()
insample_forecasts.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds  | y     | MSTL       | MSTL-lo-99 | MSTL-hi-99 |
|-----|-----------|-----|-------|------------|------------|------------|
| 0   | H1        | 1   | 605.0 | 604.924500 | 588.010376 | 621.838623 |
| 1   | H1        | 2   | 586.0 | 585.221802 | 568.307678 | 602.135925 |
| 2   | H1        | 3   | 586.0 | 589.740723 | 572.826599 | 606.654846 |
| 3   | H1        | 4   | 559.0 | 557.778076 | 540.863953 | 574.692200 |
| 4   | H1        | 5   | 511.0 | 506.747009 | 489.832886 | 523.661133 |

We can now find all the observations above or below the 99% prediction
interval for the insample forecasts.

```python
anomalies = insample_forecasts.loc[(insample_forecasts['y'] >= insample_forecasts['MSTL-hi-99']) | (insample_forecasts['y'] <= insample_forecasts['MSTL-lo-99'])]
anomalies.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds  | y     | MSTL       | MSTL-lo-99 | MSTL-hi-99 |
|-----|-----------|-----|-------|------------|------------|------------|
| 168 | H1        | 169 | 813.0 | 779.849792 | 762.935669 | 796.763916 |
| 279 | H1        | 280 | 692.0 | 672.638123 | 655.723999 | 689.552246 |
| 289 | H1        | 290 | 770.0 | 792.015442 | 775.101318 | 808.929565 |
| 308 | H1        | 309 | 844.0 | 867.809387 | 850.895203 | 884.723511 |
| 336 | H1        | 337 | 853.0 | 822.427002 | 805.512878 | 839.341187 |

We can plot the anomalies by adding the `plot_anomalies = True` argument
to the `plot` method.

```python
StatsForecast.plot(insample_forecasts, plot_random = False, plot_anomalies = True)
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/tutorials/AnomalyDetection_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-16-output-1.png)

If we want to take a closer look, we can use the `unique_ids` argument
to select one particular time series, for example, `H10`.

```python
StatsForecast.plot(insample_forecasts, unique_ids = ['H10'], plot_anomalies = True)
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/tutorials/AnomalyDetection_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-17-output-1.png)

Here we identified the anomalies in the data using the MSTL model, but
any [probabilistic
model](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/#models) from
StatsForecast can be used. We also selected the 99% prediction interval
of the insample forecasts, but other confidence levels can be used as
well.
