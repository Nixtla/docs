You can install the *released version* of
[`StatsForecast`](https://Nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/core.html#statsforecast)
from the [Python package index](https://pypi.org) with:

```python
pip install statsforecast
```

or

```python
conda install -c conda-forge statsforecast
```

<Warning>

We are constantly updating StatsForecast, so we suggest fixing the
version to avoid issues. `pip install statsforecast=="1.0.0"`

</Warning>

<Tip>

We recommend installing your libraries inside a python virtual or [conda
environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html).

```

1.  Activate the environment:
