## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

-   A **Time Series** is defined as a series of data points recorded at
    different time intervals. The time order can be daily, monthly, or
    even yearly.

-   Time Series forecasting is the process of using a statistical model
    to predict future values of a time series based on past results.

-   We have discussed various aspects of **Time Series Forecasting** in
    the previous notebook.

-   Forecasting is the step where we want to predict the future values
    the series is going to take. Forecasting a time series is often of
    tremendous commercial value.

**Forecasting a time series can be broadly divided into two types.**

-   If we use only the previous values of the time series to predict its
    future values, it is called **Univariate Time Series Forecasting.**

-   If we use predictors other than the series (like exogenous
    variables) to forecast it is called **Multi Variate Time Series
    Forecasting.**

-   This notebook focuses on a particular type of forecasting method
    called **ARIMA modeling.**

## Introduction to ARIMA Models <a class="anchor" id="model"></a>

-   **ARIMA** stands for **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
    Model**. It belongs to a class of models that explains a given time
    series based on its own past values -i.e.- its own lags and the
    lagged forecast errors. The equation can be used to forecast future
    values. Any ‘non-seasonal’ time series that exhibits patterns and is
    not a random white noise can be modeled with ARIMA models.

-   So, **ARIMA**, short for **AutoRegressive Integrated Moving
    Average**, is a forecasting algorithm based on the idea that the
    information in the past values of the time series can alone be used
    to predict the future values.

-   **ARIMA Models** are specified by three order parameters: (p, d, q),

    where,

    -   p is the order of the AR term

    -   q is the order of the MA term

    -   d is the number of differencing required to make the time series
        stationary

-   **AR(p) Autoregression** - a regression model that utilizes the
    dependent relationship between a current observation and
    observations over a previous period. An auto regressive (AR(p))
    component refers to the use of past values in the regression
    equation for the time series.

-   **I(d) Integration** - uses differencing of observations
    (subtracting an observation from observation at the previous time
    step) in order to make the time series stationary. Differencing
    involves the subtraction of the current values of a series with its
    previous values d number of times.

-   **MA(q) Moving Average** - a model that uses the dependency between
    an observation and a residual error from a moving average model
    applied to lagged observations. A moving average component depicts
    the error of the model as a combination of previous error terms. The
    order q represents the number of terms to be included in the model.

### Types of ARIMA Model

-   **ARIMA** : Non-seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages
-   **SARIMA** : Seasonal ARIMA
-   **SARIMAX** : Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables

If a time series, has seasonal patterns, then we need to add seasonal
terms and it becomes SARIMA, short for **Seasonal ARIMA**.

## The meaning of p, d and q in ARIMA model <a class="anchor" id="concepts"></a>

### The meaning of p

-   `p` is the order of the **Auto Regressive (AR)** term. It refers to
    the number of lags of Y to be used as predictors.

### The meaning of d

-   The term **Auto Regressive**’ in ARIMA means it is a linear
    regression model that uses its own lags as predictors. Linear
    regression models, as we know, work best when the predictors are not
    correlated and are independent of each other. So we need to make the
    time series stationary.

-   The most common approach to make the series stationary is to
    difference it. That is, subtract the previous value from the current
    value. Sometimes, depending on the complexity of the series, more
    than one differencing may be needed.

-   The value of d, therefore, is the minimum number of differencing
    needed to make the series stationary. If the time series is already
    stationary, then d = 0.

### The meaning of q

-   **q** is the order of the **Moving Average (MA)** term. It refers to
    the number of lagged forecast errors that should go into the ARIMA
    Model.

## AR and MA models <a class="anchor" id="ar_ma"></a>

### AR model

In an autoregression model, we forecast the variable of interest using a
linear combination of past values of the variable. The term
autoregression indicates that it is a regression of the variable against
itself.

Thus, an autoregressive model of order p can be written as

$$

\begin{equation}
y_{t} = c + \phi_{1}y_{t-1} + \phi_{2}y_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_{p}y_{t-p} + \varepsilon_{t} \tag{1}
\end{equation}

$$

where $\epsilon_t$ is white noise. This is like a multiple regression
but with lagged values of $y_t$ as predictors. We refer to this as an
AR( p) model, an autoregressive model of order p.

### MA model

Rather than using past values of the forecast variable in a regression,
a moving average model uses past forecast errors in a regression-like
model,

$$

\begin{equation}
y_{t} = c + \varepsilon_t + \theta_{1}\varepsilon_{t-1} + \theta_{2}\varepsilon_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_{q}\varepsilon_{t-q} \tag{2}
\end{equation}

$$

where $\epsilon_t$ is white noise. We refer to this as an MA(q) model, a
moving average model of order q. Of course, we do not observe the values
of  
$\epsilon_t$ , so it is not really a regression in the usual sense.

Notice that each value of yt can be thought of as a weighted moving
average of the past few forecast errors (although the coefficients will
not normally sum to one). However, moving average models should not be
confused with the moving average smoothing . A moving average model is
used for forecasting future values, while moving average smoothing is
used for estimating the trend-cycle of past values.

Thus, we have discussed AR and MA Models respectively.

## ARIMA model <a class="anchor" id="arima"></a>

If we combine differencing with autoregression and a moving average
model, we obtain a non-seasonal ARIMA model. ARIMA is an acronym for
AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (in this context, “integration”
is the reverse of differencing). The full model can be written as

where $y'_{t}$ is the differenced series (it may have been differenced
more than once). The “predictors” on the right hand side include both
lagged values of $y_t$ and lagged errors. We call this an ARIMA(p,d,q)
model, where

|     |                                       |
|-----|---------------------------------------|
| p   | order of the autoregressive part      |
| d   | degree of first differencing involved |
| q   | order of the moving average part      |

The same stationarity and invertibility conditions that are used for
autoregressive and moving average models also apply to an ARIMA model.

Many of the models we have already discussed are special cases of the
ARIMA model, as shown in Table

Once we start combining components in this way to form more complicated
models, it is much easier to work with the backshift notation. For
example, the above equation can be written in backshift notation as

### ARIMA model in words

Predicted Yt = Constant + Linear combination Lags of Y (upto p lags) +
Linear Combination of Lagged forecast errors (upto q lags)

## How to find the order of differencing (d) in ARIMA model <a class="anchor" id="order_d"></a>

-   As stated earlier, the purpose of differencing is to make the time
    series stationary. But we should be careful to not over-difference
    the series. An over differenced series may still be stationary,
    which in turn will affect the model parameters.

-   So we should determine the right order of differencing. The right
    order of differencing is the minimum differencing required to get a
    near-stationary series which roams around a defined mean and the ACF
    plot reaches to zero fairly quick.

-   If the autocorrelations are positive for many number of lags (10 or
    more), then the series needs further differencing. On the other
    hand, if the lag 1 autocorrelation itself is too negative, then the
    series is probably over-differenced.

-   If we can’t really decide between two orders of differencing, then
    we go with the order that gives the least standard deviation in the
    differenced series.

-   Now, we will explain these concepts with the help of an example as
    follows:

    -   First, I will check if the series is stationary using the
        **Augmented Dickey Fuller test (ADF Test)**, from the
        statsmodels package. The reason being is that we need
        differencing only if the series is non-stationary. Else, no
        differencing is needed, that is, d=0.

    -   The null hypothesis (Ho) of the ADF test is that the time series
        is non-stationary. So, if the p-value of the test is less than
        the significance level (0.05) then we reject the null hypothesis
        and infer that the time series is indeed stationary.

    -   So, in our case, if P Value \> 0.05 we go ahead with finding the
        order of differencing.

## Loading libraries and data <a class="anchor" id="loading"></a>

<Tip>

Statsforecast will be needed. To install, see
[instructions](../getting-started/installation.html).

</Tip>

Next, we import plotting libraries and configure the plotting style.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
plt.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 1.5
dark_style = {
    'figure.facecolor': '#212946',
    'axes.facecolor': '#212946',
    'savefig.facecolor':'#212946',
    'axes.grid': True,
    'axes.grid.which': 'both',
    'axes.spines.left': False,
    'axes.spines.right': False,
    'axes.spines.top': False,
    'axes.spines.bottom': False,
    'grid.color': '#2A3459',
    'grid.linewidth': '1',
    'text.color': '0.9',
    'axes.labelcolor': '0.9',
    'xtick.color': '0.9',
    'ytick.color': '0.9',
    'font.size': 12 }
plt.rcParams.update(dark_style)

from pylab import rcParams
rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (18,7)
```

### Read data

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naren8520/Serie-de-tiempo-con-Machine-Learning/main/Data/Esperanza_vida.csv", usecols=[1,2])
df.head()
```

|     | year       | value     |
|-----|------------|-----------|
| 0   | 1960-01-01 | 69.123902 |
| 1   | 1961-01-01 | 69.760244 |
| 2   | 1962-01-01 | 69.149756 |
| 3   | 1963-01-01 | 69.248049 |
| 4   | 1964-01-01 | 70.311707 |

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in long format with
three columns: unique_id, ds and y:

-   The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier
    for the series.

-   The `ds` (datestamp) column should be of a format expected by
    Pandas, ideally YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a
    timestamp.

-   The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast.

```python
df["unique_id"]="1"
df.columns=["ds", "y", "unique_id"]
df.head()
```

|     | ds         | y         | unique_id |
|-----|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 0   | 1960-01-01 | 69.123902 | 1         |
| 1   | 1961-01-01 | 69.760244 | 1         |
| 2   | 1962-01-01 | 69.149756 | 1         |
| 3   | 1963-01-01 | 69.248049 | 1         |
| 4   | 1964-01-01 | 70.311707 | 1         |

```python
print(df.dtypes)
```

``` text
ds            object
y            float64
unique_id     object
dtype: object
```

We need to convert `ds` from the `object` type to datetime.

```python
df["ds"] = pd.to_datetime(df["ds"])
```

## Explore data with the plot method <a class="anchor" id="plotting"></a>

Plot a series using the plot method from the StatsForecast class. This
method prints a random series from the dataset and is useful for basic
EDA.

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast

StatsForecast.plot(df)
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/models/ARIMA_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-7-output-1.png)

Looking at the plot we can observe there is an upward trend over the
period of time.

```python
df["y"].plot(kind='kde',figsize = (16,5))
df["y"].describe()
```

``` text
count    60.000000
mean     76.632439

### Seasonal Decomposed

How to decompose a time series and why?

In time series analysis to forecast new values, it is very important to
know past data. More formally, we can say that it is very important to
know the patterns that values follow over time. There can be many
reasons that cause our forecast values to fall in the wrong direction.
Basically, a time series consists of four components. The variation of
those components causes the change in the pattern of the time series.
These components are:

-   **Level:** This is the primary value that averages over time.
-   **Trend:** The trend is the value that causes increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Seasonality:** This is a cyclical event that occurs in a time
    series for a short time and causes short-term increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Residual/Noise:** These are the random variations in the time
    series.

Combining these components over time leads to the formation of a time
series. Most time series consist of level and noise/residual and trend
or seasonality are optional values.

If seasonality and trend are part of the time series, then there will be
effects on the forecast value. As the pattern of the forecasted time
series may be different from the previous time series.

The combination of the components in time series can be of two types: \*
Additive \* multiplicative

### Additive time series

If the components of the time series are added to make the time series.
Then the time series is called the additive time series. By
visualization, we can say that the time series is additive if the
increasing or decreasing pattern of the time series is similar
throughout the series. The mathematical function of any additive time
series can be represented by:
$$y(t) = level + Trend + seasonality + noise$$

### Multiplicative time series

If the components of the time series are multiplicative together, then
the time series is called a multiplicative time series. For
visualization, if the time series is having exponential growth or
decline with time, then the time series can be considered as the
multiplicative time series. The mathematical function of the
multiplicative time series can be represented as.

$$y(t) = Level * Trend * seasonality * Noise$$

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
```


```python
decomposed=seasonal_decompose(df["y"], model = "add", period=1)
decomposed.plot()
plt.show()
```

### The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test

An Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a type of statistical test that
determines whether a unit root is present in time series data. Unit
roots can cause unpredictable results in time series analysis. A null
hypothesis is formed in the unit root test to determine how strongly
time series data is affected by a trend. By accepting the null
hypothesis, we accept the evidence that the time series data is not
stationary. By rejecting the null hypothesis or accepting the
alternative hypothesis, we accept the evidence that the time series data
is generated by a stationary process. This process is also known as
stationary trend. The values of the ADF test statistic are negative.
Lower ADF values indicate a stronger rejection of the null hypothesis.

Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test is a common statistical test used to test
whether a given time series is stationary or not. We can achieve this by
defining the null and alternate hypothesis.

Null Hypothesis: Time Series is non-stationary. It gives a
time-dependent trend. Alternate Hypothesis: Time Series is stationary.
In another term, the series doesn’t depend on time.

ADF or t Statistic \< critical values: Reject the null hypothesis, time
series is stationary. ADF or t Statistic \> critical values: Failed to
reject the null hypothesis, time series is non-stationary.

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller
```


```python
def Augmented_Dickey_Fuller_Test_func(series , column_name):
    print (f'Dickey-Fuller test results for columns: {column_name}')
    dftest = adfuller(series, autolag='AIC')
    dfoutput = pd.Series(dftest[0:4], index=['Test Statistic','p-value','No Lags Used','Number of observations used'])
    for key,value in dftest[4].items():
        dfoutput['Critical Value (%s)'%key] = value
    print (dfoutput)
    if dftest[1] <= 0.05:
        print("Conclusion:====>")
        print("Reject the null hypothesis")
        print("The data is stationary")
    else:
        print("Conclusion:====>")
        print("The null hypothesis cannot be rejected")
        print("The data is not stationary")
```


```python
Augmented_Dickey_Fuller_Test_func(df["y"],"Life expectancy")
```

``` text

The data is not stationary
```

We can see in the result that we obtained the non-stationary series,
because the p-value is greater than 5%.

One of the objectives of applying the ADF test is to know if our series
is stationary, knowing the result of the ADF test, then we can determine
the next step. For our case, it can be seen from the previous result
that the time series is not stationary, so we will proceed to the next
step, which is to differentiate our time series.

We are going to create a copy of our data, with the objective of
investigating to find the stationarity in our time series.

Once we have made the copy of the time series, we are going to
differentiate the time series, and then we will use the augmented Dickey
Fuller test to investigate if our time series is stationary.

```python
df1=df.copy()
df1['y_diff'] = df['y'].diff()
df1.dropna(inplace=True)
df1.head()
```

|     | ds         | y         | unique_id | y_diff    |
|-----|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1   | 1961-01-01 | 69.760244 | 1         | 0.636341  |
| 2   | 1962-01-01 | 69.149756 | 1         | -0.610488 |

| 5   | 1965-01-01 | 70.171707 | 1         | -0.140000 |

Let’s apply the Dickey Fuller test again to find out if our time series
is already stationary.

```python
Augmented_Dickey_Fuller_Test_func(df1["y_diff"],"Life expectancy")
```

The data is stationary
```

We can observe in the previous result that now if our time series is
stationary, the p-value is less than 5%.

Now our time series is stationary, that is, we have only differentiated
1 time, therefore, the order of our parameter $d=1$.

```python
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, )
axes[0, 0].plot(df1["y"]); axes[0, 0].set_title('Original Series')
plot_acf(df1["y"], ax=axes[0, 1],lags=20)

axes[1, 0].plot(df1["y"].diff()); axes[1, 0].set_title('1st Order Differencing')
plot_acf(df1["y"].diff().dropna(), ax=axes[1, 1],lags=20)


plt.show()
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/models/ARIMA_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-16-output-1.png)

-   For the above data, we can see that the time series reaches
    stationarity with one orders of differencing.

## How to find the order of the AR term (p) <a class="anchor" id="order_p"></a>

-   The next step is to identify if the model needs any AR terms. We
    will find out the required number of AR terms by inspecting the
    **Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plot**.

-   **Partial autocorrelation** can be imagined as the correlation
    between the series and its lag, after excluding the contributions
    from the intermediate lags. So, PACF sort of conveys the pure
    correlation between a lag and the series. This way, we will know if
    that lag is needed in the AR term or not.

-   Partial autocorrelation of lag (k) of a series is the coefficient of
    that lag in the autoregression equation of $Y$.

$$Yt = \alpha0 + \alpha1 Y{t-1} + \alpha2 Y{t-2} + \alpha3 Y{t-3}$$

-   That is, suppose, if $Y_t$ is the current series and $Y_{t-1}$ is
    the lag 1 of $Y$, then the partial autocorrelation of lag 3
    $(Y_{t-3})$ is the coefficient $\alpha_3$ of $Y_{t-3}$ in the above
    equation.

-   Now, we should find the number of AR terms. Any autocorrelation in a
    stationarized series can be rectified by adding enough AR terms. So,
    we initially take the order of AR term to be equal to as many lags
    that crosses the significance limit in the PACF plot.

```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2)
axes[0].plot(df1["y"].diff()); axes[0].set_title('1st Differencing')
axes[1].set(ylim=(0,5))
plot_pacf(df1["y"].diff().dropna(), ax=axes[1],lags=20)

plt.show()
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/models/ARIMA_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-17-output-1.png)

-   We can see that the PACF lag 1 is quite significant since it is well
    above the significance line. So, we will fix the value of p as 1.

## How to find the order of the MA term (q) <a class="anchor" id="order_q"></a>

-   Just like how we looked at the PACF plot for the number of AR terms,
    we will look at the ACF plot for the number of MA terms. An MA term
    is technically, the error of the lagged forecast.

-   The ACF tells how many MA terms are required to remove any
    autocorrelation in the stationarized series.

-   Let’s see the autocorrelation plot of the differenced series.

```python
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2)
axes[0].plot(df1["y"].diff()); axes[0].set_title('1st Differencing')
axes[1].set(ylim=(0,1.2))
plot_acf(df["y"].diff().dropna(), ax=axes[1], lags=20)

plt.show()
```

![](/statsforecast/docs/models/ARIMA_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-18-output-1.png)

-   We can see that couple of lags are well above the significance line.
    So, we will fix q as 1. If there is any doubt, we will go with the
    simpler model that sufficiently explains the Y.

## How to handle if a time series is slightly under or over differenced <a class="anchor" id="differencing"></a>

-   It may happen that the time series is slightly under differenced.
    Differencing it one more time makes it slightly over-differenced.

-   If the series is slightly under differenced, adding one or more
    additional AR terms usually makes it up. Likewise, if it is slightly
    over-differenced, we will try adding an additional MA term.

## Implementation of ARIMA with StatsForecast <a class="anchor" id="implementation"></a>

Now, we have determined the values of p, d and q. We have everything
needed to fit the ARIMA model. We will use the ARIMA() implementation in
the `statsforecast` package.

The parameters found are: \* For the autoregressive model, $p=1$ \* for
the moving average model $q=1$ \* and for the stationarity of the model
with a differential with an order $d=1$

Therefore, the model that we are going to test is the ARIMA(1,1,1)
model.

```python
from statsforecast.models import ARIMA
```

To also know more about the parameters of the functions of the
`ARIMA Model`, they are listed below. For more information, visit the
[documentation](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#arch-model)

``` text
order : tuple (default=(0, 0, 0))
        A specification of the non-seasonal part of the ARIMA model: the three components (p, d, q) are the AR order, the degree of differencing, and the MA order.
    season_length : int (default=1)
        Number of observations per unit of time. Ex: 24 Hourly data.
    seasonal_order : tuple (default=(0, 0, 0))
        A specification of the seasonal part of the ARIMA model.
        (P, D, Q) for the  AR order, the degree of differencing, the MA order.
    include_mean : bool (default=True)
        Should the ARIMA model include a mean term?
        The default is True for undifferenced series, False for differenced ones (where a mean would not affect the fit nor predictions).
    include_drift : bool (default=False)
        Should the ARIMA model include a linear drift term?
        (i.e., a linear regression with ARIMA errors is fitted.)
    include_constant : bool, optional (default=None)
        If True, then includ_mean is set to be True for undifferenced series and include_drift is set to be True for differenced series.
        Note that if there is more than one difference taken, no constant is included regardless of the value of this argument.
        This is deliberate as otherwise quadratic and higher order polynomial trends would be induced.
    blambda : float, optional (default=None)
        Box-Cox transformation parameter.
    biasadj : bool (default=False)
        Use adjusted back-transformed mean Box-Cox.
    method : str (default='CSS-ML')
        Fitting method: maximum likelihood or minimize conditional sum-of-squares.
        The default (unless there are missing values) is to use conditional-sum-of-squares to find starting values, then maximum likelihood.
    fixed : dict, optional (default=None)
        Dictionary containing fixed coefficients for the arima model. Example: `{'ar1': 0.5, 'ma2': 0.75}`.
        For autoregressive terms use the `ar{i}` keys. For its seasonal version use `sar{i}`.
        For moving average terms use the `ma{i}` keys. For its seasonal version use `sma{i}`.
        For intercept and drift use the `intercept` and `drift` keys.
        For exogenous variables use the `ex_{i}` keys.
    alias : str
        Custom name of the model.
    prediction_intervals : Optional[ConformalIntervals]
        Information to compute conformal prediction intervals.
        By default, the model will compute the native prediction
        intervals.
```

### Instantiate the model

```python
arima = ARIMA(order=(1, 1, 1), season_length=1)
```

### Fit the Model

```python
arima = arima.fit(y=df["y"].values)
```

### Making the predictions

```python
y_hat_dict = arima.predict(h=6,)
y_hat_dict
```

``` text
{'mean': array([83.20155301, 83.20016307, 83.20064702, 83.20047852, 83.20053719,
        83.20051676])}
```

We can make the predictions by adding the confidence interval, for
example with 95%.

```python
y_hat_dict2 = arima.predict(h=6,level=[95])
y_hat_dict2
```

``` text
{'mean': array([83.20155301, 83.20016307, 83.20064702, 83.20047852, 83.20053719,
        83.20051676]),
 'lo-95': 0    82.399545
 1    82.072363
 2    81.820183
 3    81.607471
 4    81.420010
 5    81.250474
 Name: 95%, dtype: float64,
 'hi-95': 0    84.003561
 1    84.327963
 2    84.581111
 3    84.793486
 4    84.981064
 5    85.150560
 Name: 95%, dtype: float64}
```

You can see that the result that has been extracted in the predictions
or in any other method that we use from now on with the Arima model is a
dictionary. To extract that result we can use the `.get()` function,
which will help us to be able to extract the result of each part of the
dictionary of each of the methods that we use.

### ARIMA.forecast method

Memory efficient predictions.

This method avoids memory burden due from object storage. It is
analogous to fit_predict without storing information. It assumes you
know the forecast horizon in advance.

```python
Y_hat_df=arima.forecast(y=df["y"].values, h=6, fitted=True)
Y_hat_df
```

``` text
{'mean': array([83.20155301, 83.20016307, 83.20064702, 83.20047852, 83.20053719,
        83.20051676]),
 'fitted': array([69.05477857, 69.12394817, 69.75299437, 69.15912019, 69.24378043,

```

As the result of the predictions that we have generated is a dictionary,
to make use of that result we are going to save it in `.DataFrame()`.
First we are going to generate a range of dates, then we use the
`.get()` function to extract the predictions and then we concatenate
them and save them in a DataFrame.

```python
forecast=pd.Series(pd.date_range("2014-01-01", freq="ys", periods=6))
forecast=pd.DataFrame(forecast)
forecast.columns=["ds"]
forecast
```

|     | ds         |
|-----|------------|
| 0   | 2014-01-01 |
| 1   | 2015-01-01 |
| 2   | 2016-01-01 |
| 3   | 2017-01-01 |
| 4   | 2018-01-01 |
| 5   | 2019-01-01 |

```python
df=df.set_index("ds")
```


```python
forecast["unique_id"]="1"
forecast["hat"]=y_hat_dict.get("mean")
forecast["lo-95"]=y_hat_dict2.get("lo-95")
forecast["hi-95"]=y_hat_dict2.get("hi-95")
forecast=forecast.set_index("ds")
forecast
```

|            | unique_id | hat       | lo-95     | hi-95     |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| ds         |           |           |           |           |
| 2014-01-01 | 1         | 83.201553 | 82.399545 | 84.003561 |
| 2015-01-01 | 1         | 83.200163 | 82.072363 | 84.327963 |
| 2016-01-01 | 1         | 83.200647 | 81.820183 | 84.581111 |
| 2017-01-01 | 1         | 83.200479 | 81.607471 | 84.793486 |
| 2018-01-01 | 1         | 83.200537 | 81.420010 | 84.981064 |
| 2019-01-01 | 1         | 83.200517 | 81.250474 | 85.150560 |

Once the predictions have been generated we can perform a visualization
to see the generated behavior of our model.

```python
_, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)
df_plot = pd.concat([df, forecast])
df_plot[['y', 'hat']].plot(ax=ax, linewidth=2)
ax.fill_between(df_plot.index, 
                df_plot['lo-95'], 
                df_plot['hi-95'],
                alpha=.35,
                color='orange',
                label='ARIMA-level-95')
ax.set_title('', fontsize=22)
ax.set_ylabel('', fontsize=20)
ax.set_xlabel('Timestamp [t]', fontsize=12)
ax.legend(prop={'size': 15})
ax.grid(True)
```

## Model Evaluation <a class="anchor" id="evaluate"></a>

The commonly used accuracy metrics to judge forecasts are:

1.  Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
2.  Mean Error (ME)
3.  Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
4.  Mean Percentage Error (MPE)
5.  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
6.  Correlation between the Actual and the Forecast (corr)

```python
df.reset_index("ds", inplace=True)
Y_train_df = df[df.ds<='2013-01-01'] 
Y_test_df = df[df.ds>'2013-01-01'] 

Y_train_df.shape, Y_test_df.shape
```

``` text
((54, 3), (6, 3))
```

```python
from sklearn import metrics

def model_evaluation(y_true, y_pred, Model):
    
    def mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_true, y_pred): 
        y_true, y_pred = np.array(y_true), np.array(y_pred)
        return np.mean(np.abs((y_true - y_pred) / y_true)) * 100
    print (f'Model Evaluation: {Model}')
    print(f'MSE is : {metrics.mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)}')
    print(f'MAE is : {metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)}')
    print(f'RMSE is : {np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred))}')
    print(f'MAPE is : {mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_true, y_pred)}')
    print(f'R2 is : {metrics.r2_score(y_true, y_pred)}')
    print(f'corr is : {np.corrcoef(y_true, y_pred)[0,1]}',end='\n\n')
```


```python
model_evaluation(Y_test_df["y"], forecast["hat"], "Arima")
```

``` text
Model Evaluation: Arima
MSE is : 0.08846533957222678
MAE is : 0.20228704669491057
RMSE is : 0.29743123503127034
MAPE is : 0.24430769688205894
R2 is : -0.2792859149048943
corr is : 0.3634615475289058
```

-   Around 24.43% MAPE implies the model is about 75.57% accurate in
    predicting the next 6 observations. Now we know how to build an
    ARIMA model manually.
