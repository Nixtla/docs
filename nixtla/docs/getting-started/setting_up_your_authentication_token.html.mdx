title: Setting Up Your Authentication Token
---


A **token**, also known as an **API Key**, is a unique string of
characters that serves as a key to authenticate your requests to
`TimeGTP`. This tutorial will explain how to set up your token when
using the Nixtla SDK.

Upon [registration](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/), you will recibe an
email asking you to confirm your signup. After confirming, you will
receive access to your dashboard. There, under `API Keys`, you will find
your token. To integrate your token into your development workflow with
the Nixtla SDK, you have two methods.

## 1. Direct copy and paste

-   **Step 1**: Copy the token found in the `API Keys` of your
    [dashboard]((https://dashboard.nixtla.io/)).
-   **Step 2**: Instantiate the `NixtlaClient` class by directly pasting
    your token into the code, as shown below:

```python
from nixtlats import NixtlaClient 
nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(token = 'your token here')
```

``` text
/home/ubuntu/projects/nixtla/nixtlats/nixtla_client.py:56: FutureWarning: `'token'` is deprecated; use `'api_key'` instead.
  warnings.warn(
```

This approach is straightforward and best for quick tests or scripts
that won’t be shared.

## 2. Using an environment variable

-   **Step 1:** Store your token in an environment variable named
    `NIXTLA_API_KEY`. This can be done for a session or permanently,
    depending on your preference.
-   **Step 2:** When you instantiate the `NixtlaClient` class, the SDK
    will automatically look for the `NIXTLA_API_KEY` environment
    variable and use it to authenticate your requests.

```python
from nixtlats import NixtlaClient
nixtla_client = NixtlaClient()
```

> **Important**
>
> The environment variable must be named exactly `NIXTLA_API_KEY`, with
> all capital letters and no deviations in spelling, for the SDK to
> recognize it.

There are several ways to set an environment variable.

### a. From the Terminal

Use the `export` command to set `NIXTLA_API_KEY`.

```bash
export NIXTLA_API_KEY=your_token
```

### b. Using a `.env` file

For a more persistent solution that can be version-controlled if
private, or for ease of use across different projects, place your token
in a `.env` file.

```bash
# Inside a file named .env
NIXTLA_API_KEY=your_token
```

**Within Python:** If using a `.env` file, you can load the environment
variable within your Python script. Use the `dotenv` package to load the
`.env` file and then instantiate the `NIXTLA_API_KEY` class.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from nixtlats import NixtlaClient
nixtla_client = NixtlaClient()
```

This approach is more secure and suitable for applications that will be
deployed or shared, as it keeps tokens out of the source code.

> **Important**
>
> Remember, your token is like a password - keep it secret, keep it
> safe!

## Validate your token

You can always find your token in the `API Keys` section of your
dashboard. To check the status of your token, use the `validate_api_key`
method of the `Nixtla` class. This method will return `True` if the
token is valid and `False` otherwise.

```python
nixtla_client.validate_api_key()
```

``` text
INFO:nixtlats.nixtla_client:Happy Forecasting! :), If you have questions or need support, please email ops@nixtla.io
```

``` text
True
```

You don’t need to validate your token every time you use `TimeGPT`. This
function is provided for your convenience to ensure its validity. For
full access to `TimeGPT`’s functionalities, in addition to a valid
token, you also need sufficient credits in your account. You can check
your credits in the `Usage` section of your
[dashboard]((https://dashboard.nixtla.io/)).
