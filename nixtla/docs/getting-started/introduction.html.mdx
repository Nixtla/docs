**Get started with our [QuickStart
guide](../../docs/getting-started-timegpt_quickstart), walk through
tutorials on the different capabilities, and learn from real-world use
cases in our documentation.**

## Overview

Nixtla’s TimeGPT is a generative pre-trained forecasting model for time
series data. TimeGPT can produce accurate forecasts for new time series
without training, using only historical values as inputs. TimeGPT can be
used across a plethora of tasks including demand forecasting, anomaly
detection, financial forecasting, and more.

The TimeGPT model “reads” time series data much like the way humans read
a sentence – from left to right. It looks at windows of past data, which
we can think of as “tokens”, and predicts what comes next. This
prediction is based on patterns the model identifies in past data and
extrapolates into the future.

The API provides an interface to TimeGPT, allowing users to leverage its
forecasting capabilities to predict future events. TimeGPT can also be
used for other time series-related tasks, such as what-if scenarios,
anomaly detection, and more.
