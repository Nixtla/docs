title: Setting Up Your Authentication API Key
---


An **API key** is a unique string of characters that serves as a key to
authenticate your requests to `TimeGTP`. This tutorial will explain how
to set up your API key when using the Nixtla SDK.

Upon [registration](https://dashboard.nixtla.io/), you will recibe an
email asking you to confirm your signup. After confirming, you will
receive access to your dashboard. There, under `API Keys`, you will find
your API key. To integrate your API key into your development workflow
with the Nixtla SDK, you have two methods.

## 1. Direct copy and paste

-   **Step 1**: Copy the API key found in the `API Keys` of your
    [dashboard]((https://dashboard.nixtla.io/)).
-   **Step 2**: Instantiate the `NixtlaClient` class by directly pasting
    your API key into the code, as shown below:

```python
from nixtla import NixtlaClient 
nixtla_client = NixtlaClient(api_key ='your API key here')
```

This approach is straightforward and best for quick tests or scripts
that won’t be shared.

## 2. Using an environment variable

-   **Step 1:** Store your API key in an environment variable named
    `NIXTLA_API_KEY`. This can be done for a session or permanently,
    depending on your preference.
-   **Step 2:** When you instantiate the `NixtlaClient` class, the SDK
    will automatically look for the `NIXTLA_API_KEY` environment
    variable and use it to authenticate your requests.

```python
from nixtla import NixtlaClient
nixtla_client = NixtlaClient()
```

> **Important**
>
> The environment variable must be named exactly `NIXTLA_API_KEY`, with
> all capital letters and no deviations in spelling, for the SDK to
> recognize it.

There are several ways to set an environment variable.

### a. From the Terminal

Use the `export` command to set `NIXTLA_API_KEY`.

```bash
export NIXTLA_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### b. Using a `.env` file

For a more persistent solution that can be version-controlled if
private, or for ease of use across different projects, place your API
key in a `.env` file.

```bash
# Inside a file named .env
NIXTLA_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

**Within Python:** If using a `.env` file, you can load the environment
variable within your Python script. Use the `dotenv` package to load the
`.env` file and then instantiate the `NIXTLA_API_KEY` class.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from nixtla import NixtlaClient
nixtla_client = NixtlaClient()
```

This approach is more secure and suitable for applications that will be
deployed or shared, as it keeps API keys out of the source code.

> **Important**
>
> Remember, your API key is like a password - keep it secret, keep it
> safe!

## Validate your API key

You can always find your API key in the `API Keys` section of your
dashboard. To check the status of your API key, use the
`validate_api_key` method of the `NixtlaClient` class. This method will
return `True` if the API key is valid and `False` otherwise.

```python
nixtla_client.validate_api_key()
```

You don’t need to validate your API key every time you use `TimeGPT`.
This function is provided for your convenience to ensure its validity.
For full access to `TimeGPT`’s functionalities, in addition to a valid
API key, you also need sufficient credits in your account. You can check
your credits in the `Usage` section of your
[dashboard]((https://dashboard.nixtla.io/)).
