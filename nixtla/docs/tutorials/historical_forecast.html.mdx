title: Historical forecast

---

Our time series model offers a powerful feature that allows users to
retrieve historical forecasts alongside the prospective predictions.
This functionality is accessible through the forecast method by setting
the add_history=True argument.

```python
import pandas as pd
from nixtlats import TimeGPT
```

``` text
/home/ubuntu/miniconda/envs/nixtlats/lib/python3.11/site-packages/statsforecast/core.py:25: TqdmWarning: IProgress not found. Please update jupyter and ipywidgets. See https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html
  from tqdm.autonotebook import tqdm
```

```python
timegpt = TimeGPT(
    # defaults to os.environ.get("TIMEGPT_TOKEN")
    token = 'my_token_provided_by_nixtla'
)
```

Now you can start to make forecasts! Let’s import an example:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/main/datasets/air_passengers.csv')
df.head()
```

|     | timestamp  | value |
|-----|------------|-------|
| 0   | 1949-01-01 | 112   |
| 1   | 1949-02-01 | 118   |
| 2   | 1949-03-01 | 132   |
| 3   | 1949-04-01 | 129   |
| 4   | 1949-05-01 | 121   |

```python
timegpt.plot(df, time_col='timestamp', target_col='value')
```

Let’s add fitted values. When `add_history` is set to True, the output
DataFrame will include not only the future forecasts determined by the h
argument, but also the historical predictions. Currently, the historical
forecasts are not affected by `h`, and have a fix horizon depending on
the frequency of the data. The historical forecasts are produced in a
rolling window fashion, and concatenated.

```python
timegpt_fcst_with_history_df = timegpt.forecast(
    df=df, h=12, time_col='timestamp', target_col='value',
    add_history=True,
)
```

|     | timestamp  | TimeGPT    |
|-----|------------|------------|
| 0   | 1951-01-01 | 135.483673 |
| 1   | 1951-02-01 | 144.442398 |
| 2   | 1951-03-01 | 157.191910 |
| 3   | 1951-04-01 | 148.769363 |
| 4   | 1951-05-01 | 140.472946 |

Let’s plot the results. This consolidated view of past and future
predictions can be invaluable for understanding the model’s behavior and
for evaluating its performance over time.

```python
timegpt.plot(df, timegpt_fcst_with_history_df, time_col='timestamp', target_col='value')
```

Please note, however, that the initial values of the series are not
included in these historical forecasts. This is because our model,
`TimeGPT`, requires a certain number of initial observations to generate
reliable forecasts. Therefore, while interpreting the output, it’s
important to be aware that the first few observations serve as the basis
for the model’s predictions and are not themselves predicted values.
