`TimeGPT` is a robust foundation model for time series forecasting, with
advanced capabilities such as hierarchical and bounded forecasts. To
fully leverage the power of `TimeGPT`, there are specific situations
that require special consideration, such as dealing with irregular
timestamps or handling datasets with missing values.

In this section, we will cover these special topics.
