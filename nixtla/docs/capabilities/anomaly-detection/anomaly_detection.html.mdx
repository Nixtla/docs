title: Anomaly detection
---


This section shows different recipes for anomaly detection using
TimeGPT.

Anomaly detection is the task of identifying data points that fall
outside of the normal behavior. This is a critical task, as it can help
identify fraudulent activity, a security branch, or simply highlight an
important outlier that is worth exploring more.

At a high level, anomaly detection is performed by making predictions
and generating a 99% confidence interval. If the observed point falls
outside of that interval, it is considered to be an anomaly.
