title: 'Quick Start: Frorecast a single time series'
---


In this guide you will learn how to forecast a simple series.

```python
#!pip install nixtlats
import pandas as pd
import os
from nixtlats import TimeGPT

# Instantiate the `TimeGPT` class providing your credentials.
timegpt = TimeGPT(token=os.environ['TIMEGPT_TOKEN'])

# Check you token is valid and has credits to make requests.
if timegpt.validate_token():
    print("Token validation successful!")
else:
    raise Exception("Token validation failed! Please check go to https://dashboard.nixtla.io/ to get your token.")

# We will use the air passengers dataset as an example dataset.
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/main/datasets/air_passengers.csv')

# You can also use your own dataset, just make sure it has a column with dates or datestamples (time_col) and a column with the target variable (target_col). 
# (TimeGPT can also forecast mayne different time series at once, follow the Multi Forecast example for more details)

# Make a forecast for the next 12 steps (months in this case). (Output is a pandas dataframe with the next 12 observations, h stands for horizon) 
timegpt_fcst_df = timegpt.forecast(df=df, h=12, time_col='timestamp', target_col='value')
```

``` text
Token validation successful!
```

```python
pd.concat([df, timegpt_fcst_df]).set_index('timestamp').plot()
```

```python
# Necessary package installations (though typically this isn't done within scripts but rather externally).
#!pip install nixtlats

# Importing necessary modules.
import pandas as pd  # A popular data manipulation library.
import os  # Library to interact with the operating system.
from nixtlats import TimeGPT  # Importing the TimeGPT class from nixtlats library.

# Initializing the `TimeGPT` class with a token from the environment variable.
timegpt = TimeGPT(token=os.environ['TIMEGPT_TOKEN'])

# Checking if the token provided is valid.
if timegpt.validate_token():
    print("Token validation successful!")  # Token is valid.
else:
    # Raise an exception if token validation fails.
    raise Exception("Token validation failed! Please check go to https://dashboard.nixtla.io/ to get your token.")

# Loading the air passengers dataset from a remote URL.
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nixtla/transfer-learning-time-series/main/datasets/air_passengers.csv')

# (The comment mentions we can use our own dataset, but it should have certain columns like 'timestamp' and 'value')

# Forecasting the next 12 data points (e.g., months) using TimeGPT.
# The resulting dataframe will have predictions for the next 12 time steps.
timegpt_fcst_df = timegpt.forecast(df=df, h=12, time_col='timestamp', target_col='value')

# Plotting the original data combined with the forecasted data.
# Note: there is a redundant plot call. Removed the duplicate.
pd.concat([df, timegpt_fcst_df]).set_index('timestamp').plot()
```
